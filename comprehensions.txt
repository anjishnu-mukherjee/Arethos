Here’s the grading based on the passage:

Q15. Find a word from the passage that means ‘helpless.’
Grade: 7/10
Explanation: The answer "struggling" is partially correct. While "struggling" does indicate difficulty, a closer synonym for "helpless" in the passage is "looked helpless" as directly mentioned in the context. A better choice could be "helpless" itself (if allowed) or "injured" in context.

Q16. What is the opposite of ‘dense’ as used in the passage?
Grade: 2/10
Explanation: The answer "dim" is incorrect. "Dim" refers to light intensity, not the thickness of a forest. The correct opposite of "dense" (forest) would be "sparse" or "thin."

Q17. Choose the correct word to complete the sentence:
"The bird was ____ because its wing was hurt."
Grade: 0/10
Explanation: The answer "b) excited" is completely incorrect. The bird was injured, so the correct answer should be "c) injured."

Here are some question answers:

Q1. What was unique about the bookstore named Whispering Pages?
A: It had  Mr. Alistair.

Q2. How did Eleanor react when she first opened the leather-bound book?
A: She was confused and surprised to see that the pages were blank.

Q3. What made the book unusual?
A: The book had blank pages.

Q4. What message was written in the book when Eleanor returned as an adult?
A: "Stories do not end; they only wait to be written again."

Here is the comprehension:

In the heart of an ancient city, nestled between towering stone buildings, stood a small bookshop named Whispering Pages. Unlike modern bookstores, this one had no digital catalogs or electronic payment systems—only rows of dusty shelves filled with books that carried the scent of time. The shop belonged to an old man named Mr. Alistair, whose love for literature had kept the place alive for decades.
Among the regular visitors was a young girl named Eleanor. She would spend hours flipping through pages, immersing herself in stories of distant lands and forgotten eras. Mr. Alistair, noticing her fascination, once handed her a peculiar leather-bound book with no title. “This one,” he said, “chooses its reader.”
Curious, Eleanor opened the book and gasped. The pages were blank. Confused, she looked up at Mr. Alistair, who simply smiled and said, “Sometimes, a book does not tell a story. It listens to one.” Puzzled but intrigued, Eleanor took the book home.
That night, as she thought about her day, words began to appear on the once-empty pages. They described her thoughts, her dreams, and even her unspoken fears. It was as if the book was capturing the very essence of her soul. Over time, Eleanor realized that the book was not just a reflection of her mind but also a guide, helping her understand herself better.
Years later, when Eleanor had grown up, she returned to Whispering Pages, only to find it empty. The shelves were bare, and Mr. Alistair was nowhere to be found. On the dusty counter, however, lay the same leather-bound book. This time, it held a single line written in delicate script:
"Stories do not end; they only wait to be written again."

RESPONSE:

Q1. What was unique about the bookstore named Whispering Pages?
Grade: 3/10
Explanation: The answer "It had Mr. Alistair" is incomplete and vague. The uniqueness of the bookstore lies in the fact that it had no digital catalogs or electronic payment systems, and it was filled with old books that carried the scent of time. Mr. Alistair was an important figure, but he alone did not define the bookstore’s uniqueness.

Q2. How did Eleanor react when she first opened the leather-bound book?
Grade: 9/10
Explanation: The answer accurately describes Eleanor’s reaction—she was confused and surprised to see the pages were blank. However, adding "she gasped" as mentioned in the passage would make it fully precise.

Q3. What made the book unusual?
Grade: 8/10
Explanation: The answer "The book had blank pages" is correct but lacks depth. The book was unusual not just because the pages were blank but also because it "listened" to its reader and later revealed words reflecting their thoughts. Adding this detail would make the answer more accurate.

Q4. What message was written in the book when Eleanor returned as an adult?
Grade: 10/10
Explanation: The answer exactly matches the passage: "Stories do not end; they only wait to be written again." It is precise and fully correct.

Here are some question answers:

1. Who disproved Aristotle’s idea that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones?
A: Galileo Galilei.

2. What does Newton’s law of universal gravitation describe?
A: The force of attraction between two objects based on their masses and distance.

3. What is the equation for gravitational force?
A: F = G m1 m2 / r

4. How did Einstein describe gravity in his theory of general relativity?
A: As the warping of space-time by massive objects.

5. What astronomical event confirmed Einstein’s theory of general relativity?
A: The 1919 solar eclipse, when light bending around the Sun was observed.


The Mystery of Gravity
For centuries, humans have wondered why objects fall to the ground when dropped. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. However, this idea was challenged in the 16th century by the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei. According to legend, Galileo conducted an experiment from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, dropping two spheres of different masses. He observed that both spheres hit the ground at the same time, proving that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass, assuming no air resistance.

Later, in the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton formulated his famous law of universal gravitation. He proposed that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that depends on their masses and the distance between them. This force, called gravity, explains why planets orbit the Sun and why the Moon orbits the Earth. Newton’s equation for gravitational force is:

F = G m1 m2 / r^2
 
where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.

In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein refined our understanding of gravity with his theory of general relativity. Instead of describing gravity as a force, Einstein proposed that massive objects warp the fabric of space-time, causing smaller objects to follow curved paths. This theory was confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919 when scientists observed that the Sun's gravity bent the light from distant stars.

Even today, gravity remains a fascinating topic in physics. Scientists continue to study its effects, from black holes to gravitational waves, unlocking new mysteries of the universe.

Here are some question answers:

1. If the mass of an object increases, how does the gravitational force change?
A: The force decreases, since gravity is inversely proportional to mass.

2. Why do astronauts experience weightlessness in space despite gravity still acting on them?
A: The astronauts fell this way because there is not gravity.

3. What would happen to Earth's orbit if the Sun’s gravity suddenly disappeared?
A: Earth would move in its orbit once and then fly in a random direction.

Here are some question answers:

1. Suppose you are on the Moon, where gravity is weaker than on Earth. How would your weight change?
A: It would be the same as the mass remains constant.

2. If two planets are twice as far apart as before, how does their gravitational attraction change?
A: It decreases to 1/4 of the original force, since gravity follows an inverse square law.
