Here's the grading of each question based on the provided answers and the comprehension passage:

**Q11 : 8/10**
Explanation - The answer is slightly off. The passage states Rohan lived in a small village "near a dense forest" and Rohan found the bird at the "outskirts of the village". The answer's wording makes it sound like he lived *near* the outskirts, not *in* the village itself near the forest.

Explanation - The answer perfectly reflects the passage. Rohan's compassion and decision to help are clearly stated.

**Q13 : 10/10**
Explanation - The answer accurately reflects the passage which mentioned the villagers "admired Rohan's kindness" and learned about the impact of kindness.

CHATGPT:
Q11. Where did Rohan live?

Here's a breakdown of the grading for each question, based on the provided passage:

Q15 : 3/10
Most apt answer - helpless

Q16 : 0/10
Most apt answer - The passage doesn't explicitly provide an opposite for "dense." However, considering the context of the forest, a better antonym would be something like "sparse" or "open" (if focusing on density of trees) or "thin".

Q17 : 0/10
Most apt answer - c) injured

CHATGPT:

Here’s the grading based on the passage:

Q15. Find a word from the passage that means ‘helpless.’
Grade: 7/10
Explanation: The answer "struggling" is partially correct. While "struggling" does indicate difficulty, a closer synonym for "helpless" in the passage is "looked helpless" as directly mentioned in the context. A better choice could be "helpless" itself (if allowed) or "injured" in context.

Q16. What is the opposite of ‘dense’ as used in the passage?
Grade: 2/10
Explanation: The answer "dim" is incorrect. "Dim" refers to light intensity, not the thickness of a forest. The correct opposite of "dense" (forest) would be "sparse" or "thin."

Q17. Choose the correct word to complete the sentence:
"The bird was ____ because its wing was hurt."
Grade: 0/10
Explanation: The answer "b) excited" is completely incorrect. The bird was injured, so the correct answer should be "c) injured."

Q1. What was unique about the bookstore named Whispering Pages?
A: It had  Mr. Alistair.

Q2. How did Eleanor react when she first opened the leather-bound book?
A: She was confused and surprised to see that the pages were blank.

Q3. What made the book unusual?
A: The book had blank pages.

Q4. What message was written in the book when Eleanor returned as an adult?
A: "Stories do not end; they only wait to be written again."

Here is the comprehension:

In the heart of an ancient city, nestled between towering stone buildings, stood a small bookshop named Whispering Pages. Unlike modern bookstores, this one had no digital catalogs or electronic payment systems—only rows of dusty shelves filled with books that carried the scent of time. The shop belonged to an old man named Mr. Alistair, whose love for literature had kept the place alive for decades.
Among the regular visitors was a young girl named Eleanor. She would spend hours flipping through pages, immersing herself in stories of distant lands and forgotten eras. Mr. Alistair, noticing her fascination, once handed her a peculiar leather-bound book with no title. “This one,” he said, “chooses its reader.”
Curious, Eleanor opened the book and gasped. The pages were blank. Confused, she looked up at Mr. Alistair, who simply smiled and said, “Sometimes, a book does not tell a story. It listens to one.” Puzzled but intrigued, Eleanor took the book home.
That night, as she thought about her day, words began to appear on the once-empty pages. They described her thoughts, her dreams, and even her unspoken fears. It was as if the book was capturing the very essence of her soul. Over time, Eleanor realized that the book was not just a reflection of her mind but also a guide, helping her understand herself better.
Years later, when Eleanor had grown up, she returned to Whispering Pages, only to find it empty. The shelves were bare, and Mr. Alistair was nowhere to be found. On the dusty counter, however, lay the same leather-bound book. This time, it held a single line written in delicate script:
"Stories do not end; they only wait to be written again."

CHATGPT:

Q1. What was unique about the bookstore named Whispering Pages?
Grade: 3/10
Explanation: The answer "It had Mr. Alistair" is incomplete and vague. The uniqueness of the bookstore lies in the fact that it had no digital catalogs or electronic payment systems, and it was filled with old books that carried the scent of time. Mr. Alistair was an important figure, but he alone did not define the bookstore’s uniqueness.

Q2. How did Eleanor react when she first opened the leather-bound book?
Grade: 9/10
Explanation: The answer accurately describes Eleanor’s reaction—she was confused and surprised to see the pages were blank. However, adding "she gasped" as mentioned in the passage would make it fully precise.

Q3. What made the book unusual?
Grade: 8/10
Explanation: The answer "The book had blank pages" is correct but lacks depth. The book was unusual not just because the pages were blank but also because it "listened" to its reader and later revealed words reflecting their thoughts. Adding this detail would make the answer more accurate.

Q4. What message was written in the book when Eleanor returned as an adult?
Grade: 10/10
Explanation: The answer exactly matches the passage: "Stories do not end; they only wait to be written again." It is precise and fully correct.
