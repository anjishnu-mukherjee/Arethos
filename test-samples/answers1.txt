1. Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight to make food. 
2. Photosynthesis occurs in mitochondria. 
3. The main reactants are carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. 
4. The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen. 
5. Photosynthesis helps plants grow. 
6. Hemoglobin captures light energy in plants. 
7. Carbon dioxide enters through the roots of the plant. 
8. Water provides hydrogen for glucose production and releases oxygen as a byproduct. 
9. Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis and is essential for respiration in animals. 
10. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is H2O + CO2 -> C6H12O6 + O2.
