Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This process primarily occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where sunlight is used to transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis is vital for life on Earth as it provides the primary source of energy for most ecosystems.
