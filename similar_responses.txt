The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. However, this idea was challenged in the 16th century by the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei. According to legend, Galileo conducted an experiment from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, dropping two spheres of different masses. He observed that both spheres hit the ground at the same time, proving that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass, assuming no air resistance.\n\nLater, in the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton formulated his famous law of universal gravitation. He proposed that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that depends on their masses and the distance between them. This force, called gravity, explains why planets orbit the Sun and why the Moon orbits the Earth. Newton’s equation for gravitational force is:\n\nF = G m1 m2 / r^2\n \nwhere F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Albert Einstein refined our understanding of gravity with his theory of general relativity. Instead of describing gravity as a force, Einstein proposed that massive objects warp the fabric of space-time, causing smaller objects to follow curved paths. This theory was confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919 when scientists observed that the Sun\'s gravity bent the light from distant stars.\n\nEven today, gravity remains a fascinating topic in physics.

It correctly states that Rohan picked up the bird, cleaned its wound, and fed it grains to help it recover—matching the passage exactly.\n\nQ3. How did the bird show gratitude to Rohan?\nGrade: 9/10\nExplanation: The answer is mostly correct, but a slight detail is missing. The passage mentions that the bird returned to him every morning, chirping happily, which the answer captures well. However, adding that it continued doing so over time would make it even more precise.\n\nQ4.
